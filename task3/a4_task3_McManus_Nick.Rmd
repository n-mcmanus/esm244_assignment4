# Introduction:
***

In this task, the inaugural addresses from President Biden (2021) and former President Trump (2017) are analysed and directly compared. First, the most frequently used words in both speeches will be determined and visualized in a word cloud. Next, a sentiment analysis will elucidate any major tonal differences between the two speeches. The full text for Biden and Trump's inaugural addresses were sourced from the White House and Politico, respectively.
